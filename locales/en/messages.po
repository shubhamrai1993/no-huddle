msgid "header.introduction"
msgstr "Don't start a call without context. Provide context about what you need to discuss, how long it will take, and offer scheduling options. The person you're contacting might be in deep focus, in another meeting, or dealing with personal matters. It also might not be as much of a priority as you think."

msgstr "**The issue:** Starting a call request without context forces the recipient to:\n\n- Stop their current work to decide if they want to talk\n- Mentally context-switch without preparation\n- Wonder if it's urgent or can wait\n- Feel obligated to respond immediately\n\nThis creates unnecessary interruptions and anxiety."
